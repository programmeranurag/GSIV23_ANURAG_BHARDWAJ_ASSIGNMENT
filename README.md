Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on this assignment and deliver the same.

Steps to run the code:
1. Download the zip from GitHub and open IDE and navigate to the root directory of project through cd command.
2. Open the terminal and run npm install to install the dependencies.
3. After the dependencies are installed, run npm start. This would start the server on localhost.


Areas to improve:
1. Search functionality works fine with suggestions, however they are not displayed as columns, hence would need to work towards it.
2. Open only movie details of the one typed in search bar,
3. Could add light/dark mode for UI improvement.
